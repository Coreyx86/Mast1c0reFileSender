# Mast1c0reFileSender
 A GUI tool to easily send .iso or .elf file payloads to the [mast1c0re-ps2-elf-loader made by McCaulay ](https://github.com/McCaulay/mast1c0re-ps2-elf-loader)
This is meant to be an alternative to the tools that McCaulay provided in his repo as I could not get those to work in my environment.
