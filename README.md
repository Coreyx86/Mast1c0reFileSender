# Mast1c0reFileSender
 A GUI tool to easily send .iso or .elf file payloads to the [mast1c0re-ps2-elf-loader made by McCaulay ](https://github.com/McCaulay/mast1c0re-ps2-elf-loader)
This is meant to be an alternative to the tools that McCaulay provided in his repo as I could not get those to work in my environment.

This is a .net6 application, so you will need to download and install the necessary pre-requisite for that before attempting to launch this application. 

# How to use

  - Configure the IP address with the IP address of your target console
  - Configure the port, the default port is 9045. *I advise to not change this!*
  - Open a valid .iso or .elf payload to send either through the GUI or by drag and dropping a file onto the application's window.
  - Send that bad boy
